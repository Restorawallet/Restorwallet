## 📊 Market Problem
Billions have been lost due to:
- ❌ Vulnerable seed phrases (BIP-39 risks, phishing attacks).  
- ❌ Single-layer recovery methods (no backup protection).  
- ❌ Fragmented gas fees (multiple tokens for different chains).  
- ❌ Complex UX that scares away newcomers.  

👉 **Restora Wallet solves them all.**
